# mailroom
You work in the mail room at a local charity. Part of your job is to write incredibly boring, repetitive emails thanking your donors for their generous gifts. You are tired of doing this over an over again, so youâ€™ve decided to let Python help you out of a jam.  You want to write a small command-line script that can handle some of the tasks associated with this job for you.
